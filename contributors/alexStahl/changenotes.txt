alex change notes 10/25/17

1) added synthAlex2. Main new feature is dual Cyc voices. This enables distinct inhale and exhale sounds, for a better sense of agency.

1a) Erm, it turns out that another new feature of synthAlex2 is that the controls work. In the previous version about half of them did things that can hardly be called work.

2) in alexSynthControl, added pasSynthEditor0.8 (GUI for synthAlex2). This is a replacement for paFlow0.6, that should be deprecated as soon as alexSynth2 is welcomed.

3) new versions of dependencies for alexSynth2.

4) many minor improvements to synth and GUI: log frequency and amplitude modulation, mod curve shape knob, Mira frame, etc.

5) tweaked alexSynthControl so a bang to its inlet opens its window (or brings it to the front).

6) added norm3Alex. Minor change to insure a minimum duration and some overlap between states. This is to facilitate triggering a sound to span multiple states, e.g. inhale and hold.

7) added more flexible mod curve warping function to address the timing and sense of correlation between breath and feedback. Includes exponential, half-sine S curve, and linear range offset controls. 

8) added alexnorm3, that uses slope of raw data as input to state machine.
